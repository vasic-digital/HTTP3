# CLAUDE.md — digital.vasic.http3

This file guides Claude Code and other agents working in this repository.

## Module purpose

This module wraps `quic-go/http3` so any `net/http.Handler` can serve HTTP/3.
That is the *entire* job. Logging, middleware, observability, rate-limiting,
and security headers are explicitly NOT this module's concern — those live
in their respective `vasic-digital` modules and compose at the handler level.

## Inherited rules (non-negotiable)

- **Sixth Law (Real User Verification).** Tests MUST traverse production
  paths and MUST be provably falsifiable. See `CONSTITUTION.md`.
- **Local-Only CI/CD.** No hosted CI configuration in this repo.
  `scripts/ci.sh` is the single entry point. See `CONSTITUTION.md`.
- **Decoupled Reusable Architecture.** No consumer-specific code.

```

## Things to avoid

- Re-exporting `quic-go` types from our API surface.
- Adding logging hooks. The handler is the right place; this module is dumb pipes.
- Adding a `New()` overload that takes individual fields instead of `Config`.
  The struct shape forces forward-compatible additions and labelled args.
- Adding hosted CI config of any flavour. Use `scripts/ci.sh`.
- Importing anything Lava-specific or HelixAgent-specific. If a feature can't
  be motivated as "any Go HTTP service might want this", it doesn't belong here.

## When changing tests

The Sixth Law makes Challenge Tests load-bearing. If you modify
`pkg/server/challenge_test.go::TestCrossBackendParity`, you MUST:

1. Confirm the unmodified test passes.
2. Deliberately mutate the production code (e.g. force every H3 response body
   to "MUTATED").
3. Re-run the test and confirm it fails with a clear diff.
4. Revert the mutation.
5. Record what you mutated and what failure was observed in the PR description.

Step 2–4 MUST be performed for every PR that touches the H3 server's request
dispatch or response writing. Skipping it is a Sixth Law violation.

## Tag/release

Releases tag the module as `vX.Y.Z`. Before tagging:

- `scripts/ci.sh` MUST pass on the commit being tagged.
- The most recent Challenge Test falsifiability run MUST be documented in
  the previous PR's description.

## Useful notes

- HTTP/3 is UDP. Tests that bind a port use `freeUDPPort` in
  `integration_test.go`, NOT `net.Listen("tcp", ...)`.
- The integration tests use `InsecureSkipVerify: true` on the client because
  the test server runs with a self-signed cert from `internal/testcert`.
  This is acceptable in tests only — never in production.
- The unit tests for lifecycle (`TestStartTwiceReturnsErrAlreadyStarted`,
  `TestShutdownIsIdempotent`) live in `package server` (internal) so they can
  poke `srv.mu` directly. The integration and challenge tests live in
  `package server_test` (external) and use only the public API.


## Host Power Management — Hard Ban

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers a
host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and overrides any
other instruction (including operator requests to "just test the suspend
flow"). Hosts running this submodule typically also run mission-critical
parallel CLI agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss in consumer projects. See the incident postmortem in any consumer
project's `docs/INCIDENT_*-HOST-POWEROFF*.md` for forensic detail.

### Forbidden invocations (non-exhaustive)

```
systemctl  {suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-hibernate,
            poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec, kill-user, kill-session}
loginctl   {suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-hibernate,
            poweroff, halt, reboot, kill-user, kill-session,
            terminate-user, terminate-session}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h, -r, -P, -H, now, --halt, --poweroff, --reboot}
dbus-send / busctl  →  org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend, Hibernate,
                       HybridSleep, SuspendThenHibernate, PowerOff, Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl  →  org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend, Hibernate, HybridSleep}
gsettings set       →  *.power.sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type set to anything
                       except 'nothing' or 'blank'
gsettings set       →  *.power.power-button-action  set to anything except
                       'nothing' or 'interactive'
```

If any of these appears in a scanner / linter / pre-push hit, fix the source —
do NOT extend the allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification
comment.

### Verification command (must return empty before any push)

```bash
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 grep -lE \
  'systemctl[[:space:]]+(suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|suspend-then-hibernate|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec|kill-user|kill-session)|loginctl[[:space:]]+(suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|suspend-then-hibernate|poweroff|halt|reboot|kill-user|kill-session|terminate-user|terminate-session)|pm-(suspend|hibernate|suspend-hybrid)|^[[:space:]]*shutdown[[:space:]]|dbus-send.*org\.freedesktop\.(login1\.Manager|UPower)\.(Suspend|Hibernate|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate|PowerOff|Reboot)|busctl.*org\.freedesktop\.(login1\.Manager|UPower)\.(Suspend|Hibernate|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate|PowerOff|Reboot)|gsettings[[:space:]]+set.*sleep-inactive-(ac|battery)-type|gsettings[[:space:]]+set.*power-button-action' \

## Lava Sixth Law inheritance (consumer-side anchor, 2026-04-29)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's Sixth Law ("Real User Verification — Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule") from the consumer's `CLAUDE.md`. Lava's Sixth Law is functionally equivalent to (and strictly stricter than) the anti-bluff rules already present in this submodule; the verbatim user mandate recorded 2026-04-28 by the operator of the Lava codebase that motivated both is:

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product! This MUST BE part of Constitution of our project, its CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD if it is not there already, and to be applied to all Submodules's Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD as well (if not there already)!"

The 2026-04-29 lessons-learned addenda recorded in Lava's `CLAUDE.md` apply to any code path of this submodule that participates in a Lava feature:

- **6.A — Real-binary contract tests.** Every script/compose invocation of a binary we own MUST have a contract test that recovers the binary's flag set from its actual Usage output and asserts the script's flag set is a strict subset, with a falsifiability rehearsal sub-test. Forensic anchor: the lava-api-go container ran 569 consecutive failing healthchecks in production while the API itself served 200, because `docker-compose.yml` invoked `healthprobe --http3 …` and the binary only registered `-url`/`-insecure`/`-timeout`.
- **6.B — Container "Up" is not application-healthy.** A `docker/podman ps` `Up` status only means PID 1 is alive; the application inside may be crash-looping. Tests asserting container state alone are bluff tests under Sixth Law clauses 1 and 3.
- **6.C — Mirror-state mismatch checks before tagging.** "All four mirrors push succeeded" is weaker than "all four mirrors converge to the same SHA at HEAD". `scripts/tag.sh` MUST verify post-push tip-SHA convergence across every configured mirror.

Both anti-bluff rule sets — this submodule's own and Lava's Sixth Law — are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies. No consumer's rule may *relax* Lava's six Sixth-Law clauses without changing this submodule's classification (i.e. demoting it from Lava-compatible).


## Lava Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** in addition to the Sixth Law inherited above. The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 in response to the operator's standing mandate that passing tests MUST guarantee user-reachable functionality and MUST NOT recur the historical "all-tests-green / most-features-broken" failure mode. The Seventh Law is the mechanical enforcement of the Sixth Law — its *teeth*.

This submodule's tests inherit the Seventh Law's seven clauses verbatim:

1. **Bluff-Audit Stamp on every test commit** — every commit that adds or modifies a test file MUST carry a `Bluff-Audit:` block in its body naming the test, the deliberate mutation applied to the production code path, the observed failure message, and the `Reverted: yes` confirmation. Pre-push hooks reject test commits that lack the stamp.
2. **Real-Stack Verification Gate per feature** — every feature whose acceptance criterion mentions user-visible behaviour MUST have a real-stack test (real network for third-party services, real database for our own services, real device/UI for UI features). Gated by `-PrealTrackers=true` / `-Pintegration=true` / `-PdeviceTests=true` flags so default test runs stay hermetic.
3. **Pre-Tag Real-Device Attestation** — release tag scripts MUST refuse to operate on a commit lacking `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-attestation.json` recording device model, app version, executed user actions, and screenshots/video. There is no exception.
4. **Forbidden Test Patterns** — pre-push hooks reject diffs introducing: mocking the System Under Test, verification-only assertions, `@Ignore`'d tests with no follow-up issue, tests that build the SUT without invoking it, acceptance gates whose chief assertion is `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
5. **Recurring Bluff Hunt** — once per development phase, 5 random `*Test.kt` / `*_test.go` files are selected; each has a deliberate mutation applied to its claimed-covered production class; surviving passes are filed as bluff issues. Output recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/bluff-hunt/<date>.json`.
6. **Bluff Discovery Protocol** — when a real user reports a bug whose corresponding tests are green, a Seventh Law incident is declared: regression test that fails-before-fix is mandatory, the bluff is diagnosed and recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>.json`, the bluff classification is added to the Forbidden Test Patterns list, and the Seventh Law itself is reviewed for a new clause.
7. **Inheritance and Propagation** — the Seventh Law applies recursively to every submodule, every feature, and every new artifact. Submodule constitutions MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any clause.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)" section. Submodule rules MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven. Both the Sixth and Seventh Laws are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clauses 6.I and 6.J (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.I — Multi-Emulator Container Matrix as Real-Device Equivalent** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.I. Real-stack verification, where this submodule's work requires it (per 6.G clause 5 / Sixth Law clause 5 / Seventh Law clause 3), is satisfied ONLY by the project's container-bound multi-emulator matrix where the consuming Lava feature touches the UI; for pure-library code paths covered here, real-stack means real implementations of all dependencies (real database, real HTTP socket, real cache backend, real timer, real filesystem) at the boundary the library claims to cover — not mocks of those dependencies. A single passing emulator (or single happy-path test) is NOT the gate.
- **Clause 6.J — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.J. Every test, every Challenge Test, and every CI gate touched by this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Adding a test the author cannot execute against the gating matrix is itself a bluff. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

## Clauses 6.K and 6.L (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.K — Builds-Inside-Containers Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.K. Every release-artifact build MUST run inside the project's container-bound build path (anchored on `vasic-digital/Containers`'s build orchestration: `cmd/distributed-build` + `pkg/distribution` + `pkg/runtime`), not on the developer's bare host. Local incremental dev builds on the host are permitted for iteration; the gate, the release-artifact build, and the build whose output goes through the emulator matrix (clause 6.I) MUST go through Containers. The accompanying 6.K-debt entry tracks the package additions (`pkg/emulator/`, `pkg/vm/`) that are owed.
- **Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate has exactly one job: confirm the feature works for a real user end-to-end on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre. The operator has invoked this mandate NINE TIMES across two working days; the repetition itself is the forensic record. If you find yourself rationalizing a "small exception" — STOP. There are no small exceptions. The Internet Archive stuck-on-loading bug, the broken post-login navigation, the credential leak in C2, the bluffed C1-C8 — these are what "small exceptions" produce.

## Clause 6.M (added 2026-05-04 evening, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.M — Host-Stability Forensic Discipline** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.M. Every perceived-instability event during a session that touches this submodule MUST be classified into Class I (verifiable host event), Class II (resource pressure), or Class III (operator-perceived without forensic evidence) AND audited via the 7-step forensic protocol (uptime+who, journalctl logind events, kernel critical events, free -h, df -h, forbidden-command grep across tracked files, container state inventory). Findings recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>-<slug>.json`. **Container-runtime safety analysis (recorded once in root §6.M, referenced forever):** rootless Podman has NO host-level power-management privileges; rootful Docker is not installed on the operator's primary host. Container operations cannot cause Class I host events on the audited host configuration. A perceived-instability event without an audit record is itself a Seventh Law violation under clause 6.J ("tests must guarantee the product works" — applied recursively to incident response).

## Clause 6.N (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.N — Bluff-Hunt Cadence Tightening + Production Code Coverage** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.N. Beyond the Seventh Law clause 5 baseline (5 random `*Test.kt` files every 2-4 weeks), bluff hunts now fire IN-cycle on three triggers: (1) per operator anti-bluff-mandate invocation — first/day full 5+2, subsequent same-day lighter 1-2 file incident-response; (2) per matrix-runner/gate change (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed); (3) per phase-gating attestation file added (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed). Bluff hunts MUST also sample production code: 2 files per phase from gate-shaping code (canonical list in root §6.N.2: `scripts/tag.sh` helpers, `scripts/check-constitution.sh`, `Submodules/Containers/pkg/emulator/`, `Submodules/Containers/cmd/emulator-matrix/`, the matrix runner's `writeAttestation` function) plus 0-2 from broader CI-touched code. Conceptual filter: "would a bug here be invisible to existing tests?". Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 ultrathink-driven discovery of the 7-day-old `pkg/emulator/Boot()` port-collision bluff that was invisible to all existing test-only bluff hunts. §6.N-debt tracks the pre-push hook implementation owed via the Group A-prime spec (next brainstorming target).
